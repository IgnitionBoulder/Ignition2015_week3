**- What is a framework?** <br>
A framework is directory that encapsulates shared resources, such as a dynamic shared library, nib files, image files, localized strings, header files, and reference documentation in a single package. This way, you can have multiple applications using the same framework simultaneously instead of writing a ton of code for each app. 

**- What's the difference between a programming language and a framework?** <br>
A programming language is syntax, grammar, and semantics that implementers are required to support. A framework is a cohesive set of library code that together simplifies programming in any given language for multiple applications the framework just has to be available for the prgramming language, but not actually written in it. 

**- Whatâ€™s the difference between a library and a framework?** <br>
The difference between a library and a framework is when you call a method from a library, you are in control, you are calling the method. But with a framework, the framework is in control and the framework will call you.
