- What is a framework?  
    - A web framework is a software framework designed to simplify your web development life.

Typically frameworks provide libraries for accessing a database, managing sessions and cookies, creating templates to display your HTML and in general, promote the reuse of code.

    -  A library is a collection of objects/functions/methods (depending on your language) and your application "links" against it and thus can use the objects/functions/methods. It is basically a file containing re-usable code that can usually be shared among multiple applications (you don't have to write the same code over and over again).
