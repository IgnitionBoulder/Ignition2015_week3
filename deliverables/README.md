- What is a framework?<br>A framework is a term used to describe collections of code for common or repetitive tasks that have been created and placed in open-source files that are available for developers and programmers to make use of.  This is a direct result of the 'Don't Repeat Yourself' (DRY) mantra.  By collecting code for common operations and repetitive tasks and grouping them together into what we call a framework, developers can access this previously written code to use and not have to write their own from scratch.<br><br>
- What's the difference between a programming language and a framework<br>A framework is a collection of previously written code that is intended to supplement a programming language.  In other words, a framework is an extension of a programming language.  The term 'framework' has no significance without an associated programming language.  The programming language provides the foundation upon which code and programs can be written; on top of this foundation we can collect sets of code that are common to many applications and group them together into what we call a framework.  Use of this framework can make some of the mundane tasks needed by programmers relatively easy because they can use code which already has been written and added to the framework within their own programs without having to start from scratch.  While coding in a particular programming language, developers will want to make use of an available framework for the language because it will make their lives easier and their code more accessible.<br><br>
