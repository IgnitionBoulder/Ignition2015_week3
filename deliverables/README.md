##### Questions
- What is a framework?
An abstraction that provides application-specific software that can be selectively changed by users.
- What's the difference between a programming language and a framework?
A programming language is the bones of a framework. It makes up applications, libraries, etc...  A framework is like a library in that it cuts a large deal of coding out of your work and sets the stage for doing lots of ...things?... quicker and easier.  That seems to make sense right?
- Whatâ€™s the difference between a library and a framework?
A library is a group of functions and objects that serve a specific purpose while a framework is a collection of libraries that have more broad uses generally made for applications
- What languages have frameworks?
Well i'm just throwing it out there but I'm pretty sure you can make a framework for pretty much any language.  I dunno, maybe I'm just throwing this out my ass right now.
