##### Questions
- What is a framework?  
  A framework is a way to organize files of code, in a very neat and clean way. It is a way to run they code together cleanily so it makes sence. It keeps thinsg in order. There are many different types of frmaeworks for each language. Athough there are more frameworks in the Ruby language rails is the most well known and most used framework in rails. Overall frameworks are open-source so they can be used for making money, modrifying them without any fees to create this. 

- What's the difference between a programming language and a framework?  
  A language is a compilation of syntax, grammar, semantics (and perhaps a core library) that implementers are required to support. A framework is a cohesive set of library code that together simplifies programming in any given language. The langugae is the interior of the framework, the framework is what holds it together and the language is what is fills it out.   
  
- Whatâ€™s the difference between a library and a framework?
  A library performs specific, well-defined operations. The library has its certain things to do within the applications. A framework is a skeleton where the application defines the "meat" of the operation by filling out the skeleton. The skeleton still has code to link up the parts but the most important work is done by the application.
  
- What languages have frameworks?  
  Pretty much all of the most prevelent languages have a frameworks. These include ASP.NET, C, C++, ColdFusion Markup Language, D, Haskell, Java, JavaScript, Scala, Perl, PHP, Python, and Ruby to name the most important and well known languages.
