- What is a framework?
-They are large bodies of prewritten code that you can add to your own code to solve certain problems. In a framework all the control flow is all ready defined, and there's a bunch of predefined white spots that you can fill out the your code.
 
- What's the difference between a programming language and a framework?
-A programming language is syntax, grammar, semantics(and perhaps a core library). Where as a framework is a set of code that simplifies programming in any given language. 

- Whatâ€™s the difference between a library and a framework?
-The difference between a library and a framework is Inversion of Control. A library is a collection of functionality that you can call. Where as a framework is very rigid because all the control flow is already handeled, thus the developer just has to fill predefined white spots with their code. When you call a library YOU are in control of the functinality provide. 

- What languages have frameworks?
