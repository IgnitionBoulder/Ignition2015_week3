##### Questions
- What is a framework?
- Like many web frameworks, Ruby on Rails uses the model–view–controller (MVC) pattern to organize application programming. In a -default configuration, a model in the Ruby on Rails framework maps to a table in a database, and a Ruby file.
- What's the difference between a programming language and a framework?
- A language is syntax, grammar, semantics.. that implementers are required to support. A framework is a cohesive set of -library code that together simplifies programming in any given language.
- What’s the difference between a library and a framework?
- A library is a set of objects and functions that is focused around solving a particular problem or around a specific area of -application development (i.e. database access); a framework on the other hand is a collection of libraries centered around a -particular methodology (i.e. MVC) and covers all areas of application development.
- What languages have frameworks?
- All I see is there can be many frameworks built from a programming language, but a framework is built from only on programming -language.
