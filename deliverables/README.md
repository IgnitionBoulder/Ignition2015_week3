##### Questions
- What is a framework?  
In computer programming, a software framework is an abstraction in which software providing generic functionality can be   selectively changed by additional user-written code, thus providing application-specific software.
(The framework should follow good Model-View-Controller (MVC) separation principles.)

- What's the difference between a programming language and a framework?
A language is syntax, grammar, semantics (and perhaps a core library) that implementers are required to support. A framework is a cohesive set of library code that together simplifies programming in any given language.

- Whatâ€™s the difference between a library and a framework?
A library is a set of objects and functions that is focused around solving a particular problem or around a specific area of application development (i.e. database access); a framework on the other hand is a collection of libraries centered around a particular methodology (i.e. MVC) and covers all areas of application development. (example: framework is changing strap on backpack and library is adding waterbottle to backpack)

- What languages have frameworks?
Vitually all languages have frameworks.
